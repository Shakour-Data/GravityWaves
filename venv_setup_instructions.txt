To resolve the import errors in VSCode, please ensure the Python interpreter is set to the virtual environment located at /home/gravitywaves/GravityWaves/.venv/bin/python. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), selecting 'Python: Select Interpreter', and choosing the interpreter path '/home/gravitywaves/GravityWaves/.venv/bin/python'. Additionally, restart VSCode after setting the interpreter to refresh the environment.
