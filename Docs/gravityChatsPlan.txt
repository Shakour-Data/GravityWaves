# GravityChats Frontend Implementation Plan

This plan follows the activity cycle described in Docs/WorkCycle.md. Each activity is sized to be manageable and executable within a reasonable timeframe.

## Activity Cycle for Each Major Activity

For each activity listed below, the following process will be followed to ensure quality and completeness:

1. Backend Code Review
   - Analyze existing backend code related to the activity
   - Identify dependencies and integration points with frontend
   - Document required backend changes or API needs

2. Frontend Changes
   - Review current frontend components impacted by the activity
   - Design and implement necessary frontend updates or new features
   - Ensure frontend aligns with backend capabilities and APIs

3. Backend Changes
   - Implement required backend code changes or enhancements
   - Develop new APIs or modify existing ones as needed
   - Add error handling, validation, and security measures

4. API Development
   - Design API endpoints to support frontend requirements
   - Implement and test API endpoints with real data
   - Document API specifications and usage

5. Writing and Reviewing Test Code
   - Write test code covering all new and changed features
   - Review test code for completeness and correctness

6. Testing with Real Data
   - Prepare comprehensive test cases covering all new and changed features
   - Perform integration testing between frontend and backend
   - Validate UI/UX across devices and browsers
   - Test API endpoints for happy paths, error handling, and edge cases
   - Document test results and any issues found
   - Repeat testing, running, and fixing until all tests pass successfully
   - Note: During the testing cycle, the process of testing, running, and fixing will be repeated until all tests pass successfully.

7. Commit and Push
   - Commit all code changes with clear, descriptive messages
   - Push commits to the remote repository
   - Update task status and documentation accordingly
