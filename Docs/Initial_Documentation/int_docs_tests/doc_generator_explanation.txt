Explanation of Docs/Initial_Documentation/doc_generator.py

This Python script is a minimal viable product (MVP) for generating markdown documentation files from a given folder containing source code files. It is designed to automate the creation of documentation by processing all relevant code files within a specified directory.

Key Features:
- Accepts a single input argument: the path to the main source code folder.
- Recursively scans the folder to find source code files with common programming language extensions (e.g., .py, .js, .ts, .java, .cpp, .c, .cs, .go, .rb, .php).
- For each code file found, generates a corresponding markdown documentation file with a placeholder header and content.
- Saves all generated markdown files into a specified output directory, creating it if it does not exist.
- Provides command-line interface with arguments for input folder and output directory.

Code Structure:
- `generate_documentation(code_folder, output_dir)`: Main function that scans the input folder, collects code files, and generates markdown documentation files with placeholder content.
- `main()`: Parses command-line arguments, ensures output directory exists, and calls the documentation generation function.

Usage:
Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the source code folder and optionally the output directory for documentation files.

Example:
```
python3 doc_generator.py /path/to/source/code --output_dir Docs/Initial_Documentation/generated_docs
```

This script serves as a foundation for integrating AI-powered documentation generation in the future by replacing the placeholder content generation with calls to AI models or MCP tools.

The code is structured for clarity and ease of extension, with comprehensive docstrings and comments to facilitate maintenance and enhancement.
