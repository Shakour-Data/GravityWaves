Project Work Plan for Docs/Initial_Documentation

1. Environment Setup
- Create a dedicated Python virtual environment named ".int_doc_venv" inside Docs/Initial_Documentation.
- Exclude the virtual environment directory from git tracking by adding ".int_doc_venv/" to the .gitignore file.

2. Documentation Instructions
- Develop comprehensive AI documentation generation instructions in Docs/Initial_Documentation/docs/ai_doc_generation_instructions.txt.
- Include detailed explanations, examples, best practices, and usage guidelines for generating markdown documentation from code files.

3. Documentation Generation Script
- Use the doc_generator.py script to generate markdown documentation files from specified code files using the AI MCP tool.
- Support specifying output directories and handle file creation.

4. Dependencies Management
- Maintain a requirements.txt file listing any Python dependencies needed for the documentation generation system.
- Ensure dependencies are installed in the virtual environment.

5. Testing and Validation
- Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies.
- Test the documentation generation script with sample code files.
- Verify the generated documentation matches the instructions and is clear and complete.
- Perform critical-path or thorough testing as per user preference.

6. Maintenance and Updates
- Keep the documentation instructions updated with any changes in the codebase or generation process.
- Update dependencies and environment setup as needed.

Next Steps:
- Confirm testing level preference (critical-path or thorough).
- Proceed with testing and fix any issues found.
- Finalize and commit all changes.

This plan will guide the work on the Docs/Initial_Documentation project to ensure a clean, maintainable, and effective documentation generation system.
