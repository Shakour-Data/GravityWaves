Backend Code Review: Detailed Plan

Objective:
Conduct a thorough review of the backend code to ensure it meets project requirements, integrates well with the frontend, and supports advanced financial market data analysis capabilities.

Steps:

1. Code Analysis
   - Review the existing backend code in app/services/assistant_analysis.py, app/services/market_analysis_system.py, app/__init__.py, and related modules.
   - Understand the current implementation of core functionalities including data fetching, analysis, caching, and response generation.
   - Identify any code smells, technical debt, or areas for improvement.

2. Dependency Mapping
   - Identify all dependencies and integration points with other backend services and the frontend.
   - Document APIs used or exposed by the backend.
   - Verify data flow and interaction with market data fetchers, cache managers, and database.

3. Feature Assessment
   - Evaluate the backend's current capabilities against the desired advanced financial market data analysis functionality.
   - Identify missing features or enhancements needed.

4. Documentation
   - Document the current state of the backend code.
   - Outline required backend changes or API needs to support enhanced features.
   - Provide recommendations for refactoring, optimization, or new feature development.

5. Planning Next Steps
   - Based on the review, create a roadmap for implementing identified improvements.
   - Prioritize tasks based on impact and complexity.
   - Coordinate with frontend and API development teams for seamless integration.

Deliverables:
- Comprehensive review report detailing findings and recommendations.
- Updated documentation reflecting current backend architecture.
- Prioritized action plan for backend enhancements.

Timeline:
- Estimated completion within 1-2 weeks, depending on complexity and resource availability.

This plan will ensure the backend code is robust, maintainable, and aligned with project goals.
