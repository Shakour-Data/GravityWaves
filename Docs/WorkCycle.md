| **2. Frontend Changes** | Review current frontend components impacted by the activity; Design and implement necessary frontend updates or new features; Ensure frontend aligns with backend capabilities and APIs |
| **3. Backend Changes** | Implement required backend code changes or enhancements; Develop new APIs or modify existing ones as needed; Add error handling, validation, and security measures |
| **4. API Development** | Design API endpoints to support frontend requirements; Implement and test API endpoints with real data; Document API specifications and usage |
| **5. Writing and Reviewing Test Code** | Write test code covering all new and changed features; Review test code for completeness and correctness |
| **6. Testing with Real Data** | Prepare comprehensive test cases covering all new and changed features; Perform integration testing between frontend and backend; Validate UI/UX across devices and browsers; Test API endpoints for happy paths, error handling, and edge cases; Document test results and any issues found. <br><br>**Testing Depth Guidance:**<br>- For critical or high-impact features, perform thorough testing covering all scenarios.<br>- For minor or low-risk changes, perform critical-path testing focusing on key elements only. |
| **7. Commit and Push** | Commit all code changes with clear, descriptive messages; Push commits to the remote repository; Update task status and documentation accordingly |
