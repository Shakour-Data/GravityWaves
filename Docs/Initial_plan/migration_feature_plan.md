# Financial Application for Migration Support to Italy and Ireland

## Information Gathered
- The current system is a Flask-based web application focused on financial market data analysis.
- The user wants to build a financial application tailored for two countries, Italy and Ireland.
- The purpose is to assist users in migrating from Iran to these countries by providing relevant financial planning and migration support features.
- This requires extending the system with country-specific financial data, migration-related financial tools, and user assistance functionalities.
- The user also wants the application to be designed so that it can quickly switch to support any country they choose in the future, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Backend Development
- Create new service modules under `app/services/` to handle country-specific financial data and migration support logic.
- Design the backend to be modular and configurable to support quick switching or addition of countries.
- Integrate data sources relevant to each supported country's financial regulations, migration costs, and planning.
- Develop APIs to provide financial and migration-related data and calculations to the frontend.

### 2. Database Schema
- Design new database tables or extend existing ones to store country-specific financial data, user migration plans, and related information.
- Ensure the schema supports multi-country data with appropriate indexing and relationships.
- Create migration scripts using Alembic to apply schema changes.

### 3. API and Routes
- Add new Flask routes in `app.py` to serve pages and API endpoints specific to each supported country.
- Implement RESTful APIs to provide financial and migration data to frontend components.
- Ensure proper error handling, validation, and security measures.

### 4. Frontend Development
- Create new HTML templates under `templates/` for migration support pages.
- Develop UI components to display financial data, migration cost calculators, and user interaction forms.
- Implement a mechanism (e.g., dropdown or settings) to allow users to switch between supported countries quickly.
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs to fetch and display real-time country-specific financial and migration information.

### 5. Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for new backend services and API endpoints.
- Develop frontend tests for UI components and user workflows.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure seamless integration.

### 6. Documentation
- Update project documentation to include details about the financial application for migration support.
- Provide user guides and API documentation for the new functionalities.

## Dependent Files to be Edited or Created
- `app/services/migration_financial_service.py` (new)
- `app.py` (add new routes)
- Database migration scripts under `migrations/`
- New templates under `templates/migration/`
- Test files under `tests/` for migration feature
- Documentation files under `Docs/Initial_plan/`

## Follow-up Steps
- After planning approval, proceed with backend service implementation.
- Develop database schema and apply migrations.
- Implement frontend templates and UI components.
- Write and run tests.
- Update documentation.
- Deploy and monitor the new feature.

This plan provides a structured approach to build a scalable and flexible financial application supporting migration from Iran to multiple countries, ensuring maintainability and quality.
