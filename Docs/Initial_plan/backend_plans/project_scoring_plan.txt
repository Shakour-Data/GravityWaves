  1.5 Implement error handling and input validation

2. Testing Tasks
  2.1 Write unit tests for scoring functions
  2.2 Perform integration testing with project management modules
  2.3 Validate scoring accuracy and report correctness
  2.4 Test edge cases and error handling

3. Documentation Tasks
  3.1 Document scoring functions and usage
  3.2 Provide examples and guidelines for scoring interpretation
  3.3 Update project management documentation
  3.4 Write troubleshooting and maintenance guide

4. Maintenance and Monitoring
  4.1 Monitor scoring module performance and errors
  4.2 Log exceptions and failures
  4.3 Plan for enhancements and algorithm updates
