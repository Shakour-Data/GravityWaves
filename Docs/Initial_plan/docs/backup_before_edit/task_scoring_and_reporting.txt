Task Scoring and Reporting System - Manual Approach

1. Scoring Criteria for Tasks

   Importance Score (1 to 100):
   - Reflects the intrinsic value and impact of the task.
   - Criteria to consider:
     * Business value and strategic alignment
     * Complexity and required expertise
     * Stakeholder priority
     * Potential risk if not done
   - Assign weights to each criterion to calculate overall importance score.

   Urgency Score (1 to 100):
   - Reflects the time sensitivity of the task.
   - Criteria to consider:
     * Deadline proximity
     * Dependencies on other tasks or projects
     * Impact of delay on overall project timeline
     * External factors (e.g., market events, regulatory deadlines)
   - Assign weights to each criterion to calculate overall urgency score.

2. Overall Task Score Calculation
   - Combine Importance and Urgency scores using a weighted formula.
   - Example formula:
     Overall Score = (W1 * Importance Score) + (W2 * Urgency Score)
     where W1 and W2 are weights reflecting the relative importance of each factor.
   - Weights can be adjusted based on project phase or management preferences.

3. Aggregation of Scores
   - Calculate average Importance, Urgency, and Overall scores for:
     * Activities (group of tasks)
     * Sub-projects (group of activities)
     * Main project (group of sub-projects)
   - Use these aggregated scores to prioritize higher-level work items.

4. Dynamic Score Adjustment Over Time
   - Importance and Urgency scores should be updated as the project progresses.
   - Consider factors such as:
     * Task delays or accelerations
     * Changes in stakeholder priorities
     * Emerging risks or opportunities
   - Define rules for score decay or increase based on elapsed time and progress.

5. Reporting
   - Generate daily reports at 10 PM automatically.
   - Reports should include:
     * Current status of tasks with scores and priorities
     * Summary of activities and project-level scores
     * Highlight urgent and important tasks
     * Progress updates and blockers
   - Reports to be saved as text files for manual review and input into project management system.

6. Manual Process
   - Initially, scoring and reporting will be done manually using the above criteria.
   - This will help refine the scoring system and understand project dynamics.
   - Once stabilized, consider automating scoring and reporting in the project management system.

This manual scoring and reporting system will enable effective prioritization and tracking of tasks and projects, supporting informed decision-making and efficient project management.
