   - Testing:
     * Write unit and integration tests for all features using real project data.
     * Perform usability testing with real users.
     * Address bugs and performance issues.
     * Ensure full work cycle is respected in all tests.
     * No use of fake data; tests must use real project data and database.
   - Deployment:
     * Prepare deployment scripts and environment configurations.
     * Set up hosting infrastructure.
     * Monitor application health and logs.

4. Deployment and Integration
   - Infrastructure Setup:
     * Choose hosting platform (cloud or on-premises).
     * Configure servers, databases, and networking.
   - CI/CD Pipeline:

     * Schedule regular maintenance windows.
   - Testing:
     * Validate deployment with real data and full work cycle.
     * Monitor logs and performance metrics post-deployment.

5. Project Management Strategy
   - Agile Process:
     * Define work cycles, sprint lengths, and ceremonies.
     * Use project management app to create and assign tasks.
     * Track progress and update statuses regularly.
   - Risk and Quality Management:
     * Identify risks and develop mitigation plans.
     * Conduct regular quality assurance and testing.
