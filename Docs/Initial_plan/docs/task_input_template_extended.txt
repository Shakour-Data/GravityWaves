# Task Input Template Extended

This document provides an extended template for task input files used in project management. It includes fields for detailed task descriptions, dependencies, risks, quality criteria, costs, stakeholders, and more.

## Template Fields

- ID: Unique identifier for the task or work package, using hierarchical notation (e.g., 1, 1-1, 1.1.1).
- Description: Brief description of the task or work package.
- Level: The hierarchical level of the task (1 to 6).
- Status: Current status (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done).
- Dependencies: List of IDs of tasks that must be completed before this task.
- Risk Description: Description of potential risks.
- Risk Impact: Impact level of risks (Low, Medium, High).
- Risk Mitigation Plan: Actions to mitigate risks.
- Quality Criteria: Criteria to measure quality.
- Quality Assurance Activities: Activities to ensure quality.
- Cost Estimate: Estimated cost.
- Cost Control Measures: Measures to control costs.
- Stakeholders: People or groups involved.
- Communication Plan: How communication will be handled.
- Procurement Needs: Required procurement items.
- Constraints: Known constraints.
- Assumptions: Assumptions made.
- Priority Level: Priority of the task.
- Critical Path Indicator: Whether the task is on the critical path.
- Task Owner: Person responsible.
- Milestone Dates: Key milestone dates.
- Deliverables: Expected deliverables.

## Usage Instructions

- The ID field must use hierarchical notation to represent the WBS structure, e.g., 1, 1-1, 1.1.1, etc.
- Each task must have a Description.
- The Level field indicates the depth in the WBS hierarchy (1 to 6).
- Each level in the WBS must have at least three child tasks in the next level.
- Initially, only the ID and Description fields are mandatory.
- Other fields such as Status, Dependencies, Risks, Costs, etc., are to be filled after the full WBS is defined.
- The WBS should be developed from the bottom up, starting with detailed tasks at level 6.
- After defining all tasks, aggregate durations, costs, and other metrics up the hierarchy.
- Use consistent formatting and naming conventions for clarity.
- Update this document as needed to reflect changes in process or requirements.

- When creating the WBS, ensure that each level has at least three child tasks in the next level to maintain a balanced structure.
- Use hierarchical IDs with separators such as hyphens or dots to clearly indicate task relationships.
- Focus initially on defining the ID and Description fields for all tasks before adding other details.
- Develop the WBS starting from the most detailed tasks (level 6) and then aggregate upwards.
- Maintain clear and consistent naming conventions to facilitate automated processing by AI tools.
- Regularly review and update the template and instructions to align with project management best practices and AI integration needs.
