Deployment and Integration - Detailed Activities and Tasks

1. Infrastructure Setup
   - Choose hosting platform (cloud or on-premises).
   - Configure servers, databases, and networking.
   - Set up security groups and firewalls.
   - Configure load balancers and DNS.

2. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Implement automated build pipelines.
   - Set up automated testing pipelines.
   - Configure deployment pipelines for staging and production.
   - Integrate code quality and security checks.

3. Application Deployment
   - Deploy project management app.
   - Deploy main project application.
   - Configure secure communication between applications.
   - Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4. Monitoring and Maintenance
   - Set up monitoring tools for uptime and performance.
   - Configure alerting and logging.
   - Plan backup and disaster recovery strategies.
   - Schedule regular maintenance windows.

5. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Generation
   - The system allows users to provide folder paths where program code resides.
   - An AI MCP tool generates the WBS up to 6 levels based on the code structure.
   - Users can also write work scenarios describing the tasks they want to perform.
   - The AI MCP interprets these scenarios and generates a detailed WBS up to 6 levels.
   - This functionality supports dynamic and flexible project planning based on real code and user input.

6. Testing
   - Validate deployment with real data and full work cycle.
   - Monitor logs and performance metrics post-deployment.
   - Conduct security and penetration testing.
